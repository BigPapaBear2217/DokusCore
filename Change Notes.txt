--------------------------------- CHANGE NOTES ---------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------- Version 1.8.1 ---------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1]: Finished off the translation for the rest of the Bounty Hunter script.
     Now the whole feature can be switched from English. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------- Version 1.8.0 ---------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1]: [Feature Added Trains]: I have incorporated the train script form
     Thunderstorm441 into DokusCore. This gives you 2 trains and 1 tram.

[2]: [Fix]: By accident deleted part of the bounty hunters code server side.
     This stopped you from getting a new bounty. The job check code is
     added back in.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------- Version 1.7.0 ---------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1]: Added multi language support. I have added the following languages:
    - Bulgarian  - Germain  - Danish  - Spanish  - French  - Greek
    - Italian    - Dutch    - Polish  - Portuguese  - Russian

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------- Version 1.6.0 ---------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1]: [Fix] The function that is scanning for your distance from the Bounty
    Boards, was returning true and false at the time due to multiple coordinates
    inside the array. As you are close for 1 of the coords, it would immediately
    set the variable back to false as you are far away from the other coords.
    Thus if you have multiple locations, it will start to glitch.
    Now we are scanning for the location itself and setting that as your closest
    Bounty Board. You are now able to add multiple locations on the list without
    running in to troubles

[2]: [Fix] When multiple BountyBoards are on the list, and you are activating a
    bounty, it would activate 1 per BountyBoard on the list resulting in multiple
    bounties at once. I have added a extra check into the code so only 1 bounty
    activates per time you click on "Hunt Bounty".  However, you are still able
    to stack multiple bounties by activating the menu more times.

[3]: [REQUESTED]: Now you can set if you need a job(s) for hunting bounties.
    Instead of setting 1 job type, I have made it so that you can set multiple
    jobs in a list. If the user has any of these jobs he will be able to hunt
    for bounties. When he does not have the job, he will receive an error.

[4]: Added 2 more BountyBoard locations to the config.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------- Version 1.5.0 ---------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1]: [Feature Added]: Play the piano like a pro on RedM. This will give you the
     abillity to play the piano in multiple saloons. Press space to start
     playing, and press F to stop playing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------- Version 1.4.2 ---------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1]: [UsableItems][Fix]: I had renamed TaskBottle to TaskDrink, this i already
     updated in the standalone, but forgot to update it in DokusCore. This is
     now fixed and drinking from a bottle now works.

[2]: [BountyHunter][Fix]: I had a little typo in the script, thus you where
     getting a error on WarBountyMenu. I requested Plugin instead of Plugins.
     When i converted this script from the standalone to DokusCore i have to
     add in a couple extra checks. This is now fixed and the BountyHunterMenu
     works now correctly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------- Version 1.4.1 ---------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1]: Added in the plugins switch for the Bounty Hunting Script
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------- Version 1.4.0 ---------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1]: [ Feature Added ]: With [ /coords ] you can now toggle your map coordinates.
     These will be shown around your minimap. You can change each coordinates
     position. The admin only option for this feature is not ready yet. This will
     be added in a later version.

[2]: [ Feature Added (BountyHunter)]: This is one of my newly made scripts. With
     this feature you are able to hun PVE and PVP bounties. Get your bounty in
     valentine and kill your objectives. Get the evidence and claim you bounty
     at the office. This feature is fully Customizable and can even be changed
     in looks and menu position.
[3]: Also pushed a couple of small fixes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------- Version 1.3.1 ---------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1]: Small patch on the metabolism script. Here I was not flooring a number thus
     creating a decimal number like (10.0). This resulted in the script being
     unable to change the users health.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------- Version 1.3.0 ---------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1]: [ Feature Added ]: BankDoors: With this switch you can open the bank doors
     of all the cities. In Valentine it also opens the doors in the back.
[2]: Changed the folder structure a little bit making it ready for later. Then
     ill be able to insert Redemrp capabilities.
[3]: Metabolism stopped working after the last update. I forgot to place the html
     files in the correct location. This is now fixed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------- Version 1.2.1 ---------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1]: Small Fix: UsableItems was unable to find the items table.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------- Version 1.1.0 ---------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1]: Removed FixHolesInMap as this is taken over by iMaps
[2]: Intergraded iMaps made by KiBook. My plugin FixHolesInMap coverd a small
     percentage of hole and glitched buildings, but iMaps fixes most of them incl
     the buildings that I fixed. Therefor I have replaced FixHolesInMap with the
     iMap version for a better coverage.
[3]: I forgot to upload the fxmanifest in the main branch and only included it
     into the developers branch. This is now fixed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------- Version 1.2.0 ---------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1]: reworked the core file structure to minimize the amount of editing and
     information needed in the fxmanifest. This will also allow me to make new
     plugins without the need of restarting the server, as the fxmanifest file
     does not need to be edited. Newly inserted files will automatically be
     found upon restarting DokusCore.
[2]: Fixed notifications. Server sided notifications did not have access to the
     functions file, as this was only placed client side.
[3]: Added in more system checks and warning message to guide the users.
[4]: Added a script termination if one of the settings are incorrect. Dokuscore
     features will then be turned off, and you receive a warning in the console.
