--------------------------------- CHANGE NOTES ---------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------- Version 1.4.1 ---------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1]: Added in the plugins switch for the Bounty Hunting Script 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------- Version 1.4.0 ---------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1]: [ Feature Added ]: With [ /coords ] you can now toggle your map coordinates.
     These will be shown around your minimap. You can change each coordinates
     position. The admin only option for this feature is not ready yet. This will
     be added in a later version.

[2]: [ Feature Added (BountyHunter)]: This is one of my newly made scripts. With
     this feature you are able to hun PVE and PVP bounties. Get your bounty in
     valentine and kill your objectives. Get the evidence and claim you bounty
     at the office. This feature is fully Customizable and can even be changed
     in looks and menu position.
[3]: Also pushed a couple of small fixes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------- Version 1.3.1 ---------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1]: Small patch on the metabolism script. Here I was not flooring a number thus
     creating a decimal number like (10.0). This resulted in the script being
     unable to change the users health.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------- Version 1.3.0 ---------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1]: [ Feature Added ]: BankDoors: With this switch you can open the bank doors
     of all the cities. In Valentine it also opens the doors in the back.
[2]: Changed the folder structure a little bit making it ready for later. Then
     ill be able to insert Redemrp capabilities.
[3]: Metabolism stopped working after the last update. I forgot to place the html
     files in the correct location. This is now fixed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------- Version 1.2.1 ---------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1]: Small Fix: UsableItems was unable to find the items table.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------- Version 1.1.0 ---------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1]: Removed FixHolesInMap as this is taken over by iMaps
[2]: Intergraded iMaps made by KiBook. My plugin FixHolesInMap coverd a small
     percentage of hole and glitched buildings, but iMaps fixes most of them incl
     the buildings that I fixed. Therefor I have replaced FixHolesInMap with the
     iMap version for a better coverage.
[3]: I forgot to upload the fxmanifest in the main branch and only included it
     into the developers branch. This is now fixed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------- Version 1.2.0 ---------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1]: reworked the core file structure to minimize the amount of editing and
     information needed in the fxmanifest. This will also allow me to make new
     plugins without the need of restarting the server, as the fxmanifest file
     does not need to be edited. Newly inserted files will automatically be
     found upon restarting DokusCore.
[2]: Fixed notifications. Server sided notifications did not have access to the
     functions file, as this was only placed client side.
[3]: Added in more system checks and warning message to guide the users.
[4]: Added a script termination if one of the settings are incorrect. Dokuscore
     features will then be turned off, and you receive a warning in the console.
