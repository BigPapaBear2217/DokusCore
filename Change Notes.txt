--------------------------------- CHANGE NOTES ---------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[ Version 1.1.0 ]: Couple fixes and removed some old code.

[1]: Removed FixHolesInMap as this is taken over by iMaps
[2]: Intergraded iMaps made by KiBook. My plugin FixHolesInMap coverd a small
     percentage of hole and glitched buildings, but iMaps fixes most of them incl
     the buildings that I fixed. Therefor I have replaced FixHolesInMap with the
     iMap version for a better coverage.
[3]: I forgot to upload the fxmanifest in the main branch and only included it
     into the developers branch. This is now fixed.

[ Version 1.2.0 ]:

[1]: reworked the core file structure to minimize the amount of editing and
     information needed in the fxmanifest. This will also allow me to make new
     plugins without the need of restarting the server, as the fxmanifest file
     does not need to be edited. Newly inserted files will automatically be
     found upon restarting DokusCore.
[2]: Fixed notifications. Server sided notifications did not have access to the
     functions file, as this was only placed client side.
[3]: Added in more system checks and warning message to guide the users.
[4]: Added a script termination if one of the settings are incorrect. Dokuscore
     features will then be turned off, and you receive a warning in the console.

[ Version 1.2.1 ]:

[1]: Small Fix: UsableItems was unable to find the items table.
