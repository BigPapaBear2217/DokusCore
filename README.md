<b> ATTENTION! </b><br>
If you update to version 1.3.0, please delete the old <br>
files first! Do not replace the old files with these, as I<br>
have done some important changes, replaced file locations and<br>
deleted some old files. Please delete all files incl the <br>
config file before copying version 1.3.0 to your server!

# Requirements
- [VorpCore](https://github.com/VORPCORE/VORP-Core)

# Discord
If you need any information about my script,<br>
if you found a bug, if you have an idea for the <br>
next version, or if you simply need some help.<br>
Feel free to join our [Discord](http://discord.gg/2gdypBhsye)

# Framework
Currently, this script only works with VORP. <br>
In the near future this script will also be <br>
compatible with RedEmRP.

# Description
DokusCore is a bundle of plugins I've made to give      <br>
RedM roleplay servers a more flexible roleplay. <br>
Instead, having to install all plugins manually,  <br>
and putting them in the right order, you can install  <br>
this on the go! Simply `ensure DokusCore` in your <br>
server cfg and you're done. If you don't like to use  <br>
any of the features, you can simply turn them off <br>
in the config. Setting up your RedM RP experience <br>
was never been easier!

# More will be added soon!
As I am developing more scripts, I will be adding     <br>
then to this bundle pack! If changes or extentions  <br>
are made to the Standalone plugin, they will also  <br>
be made in this bundle pack. Check this page  <br>
regularly if you want to stay up to date of all the  <br>
new plugins!

# Disclaimer
DokusCore is currently under development, but can already be used!   <br>
I will still be including more scripts to this  <br>
core on a daily basis. If you want to be able to  <br>
upgrade to the latest version with ease, then I would <br>
recommend not to make changes in any files other then <br>
the config file. This way you can simply download the <br>
latest version and replace your old files. Just keep in   <br>
mind that changes can be made to the config. You  <br>
can either replace the config and add in your custom changes,   <br>
or use the old config and add in the changes I made manually.   <br>
If you make any changes in the client/server files, you have  <br>
to manually change this on every update.
