# RedM-DokusCore (ONLY FOR DEVELOPMENT)
Â The Ultimate RP bundle of plugins for your RedM Server.   <br>
 This is the Development Branch! I do not recommend using <br>
 this version for your server. Please download the plugin<br>
 from the [Main](https://github.com/DevDokus/DokusCore/tree/main) Branch.<br>

# Requirements
- [VorpCore](https://github.com/VORPCORE/VORP-Core)

# Discord
If you need any information about my script,<br>
if you found a bug, if you have an idea for the <br>
next version, or if you simply need some help.<br>
Feel free to join our [Discord](http://discord.gg/2gdypBhsye)

# Framework
Currently, this script only works with VORP. <br>
In the near future this script will also be <br>
compatible with RedEmRP.

# Description
DokusCore is a bundle of plugins I've made to give      <br>
RedM roleplay servers a more flexible roleplay. <br>
Instead, having to install all plugins manually,  <br>
and putting them in the right order, you can install  <br>
this on the go! Simply ensure `DokusCore` in your <br>
server cfg and you're done. If you don't like to use  <br>
any of the features, you can simply turn them off <br>
in the config. Setting up your RedM RP experience <br>
was never been easier!
